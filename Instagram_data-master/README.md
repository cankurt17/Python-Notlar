**Instagram_data** 
============================================================

*It is a non-API Instagram spider. To use it, you don't need the official Instagram API and all you need is a normal Instagram account for login usage.*

----------
Advantages:
---------
1.	Python 3.5: I am using python 3.5 to develop this spider. As [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/) is still not fully supported for python 3.5 for now. If you want to do some crawling with python 3.5, you should try this out.
2.	Non-API: Instead of using official API to access data, I choose to use the old-school way. Thus you donâ€™t need to register as developer to use this library.
3.	Fully-functional: Every data you can find from Instagram through browser, you can get access to it with this InstagramSpider. For instance, you can get access to all the data about the users, the hash tags as well as all the medias.
4.	Highly-open: The Instagram_data library offers multiple functions to collect different data from the Instagram. You are free to use them for your own interest and develop your own program based on it.

 3. **Reminders:**
 
 1.For the function that require log-in (like getting follower and follow list or collect media from a tag), you may need to log-in first.

 2.For the cookie part I used in this class, you may need to renew it. 
 PS: you can get that through your browser
 

Examples:
---------
**I am trying to employ this spider to do some funny work. If possible, I will post those program and testing result into the example folder. Current sample project plan is as following:**

1.	Develop a mechanism to evaluate the social influence power of a specific user based on his medias

2.	Develop a mechanism to evaluate the interest distribution of a specific user based on his tags and maybe comments. (Using NLP)

3.	Develop a mechanism to study the relationship between different tags


Remarks:
---------
1. Great thanks to rarcega, whose project (https://github.com/rarcega/instagram-scraper) gave me the first hint of collecting data from Instagram without API.
2. You are free to use this spider on your own responsibility.
3. Your help is more than welcomed
